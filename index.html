<p>
One of the biggest stressors on residents of the Bronx is housing prices. They report that as rent prices go up every year, their income is not growing at an appropriate rate to keep up. This financial strain is not unfamiliar, as Americans all over the country are struggling with the cost of housing.

</p>

<p>
When looking at the U.S. Census data over the last five years, there seems to be a dispute over these reports. In Bronx County specifically, the percentage rate of income increase has actually been higher than the increase in rent prices. Due to the anecdotal reports from the borough, one would expect to see the opposite in statistics.

 However, his data does not negate the struggles of Bronx residents when analyzed deeper. John Mollenkopf, a professor of Political Science and Sociology at the CUNY Graduate Center said there is more to these statistics that meets the eye. "It is possible for mean income to rise faster than rents and for rent still to rise relative to income if the income gains are going to the top... Also, lots of people in the Bronx are living in public housing or rent regulated housing, which is going to hold increases down. People living in private market housing, however, may well feel a greater pinch," he said.

</p>


<p>
    So although the actual rates of increase may not seem reflective of the financial woes of Bronx County, there are many layers to the issue to take into account. Further research on the subject with higher variations could yield extremely different results.
